# OpenCode

The `opencode` merge hook is only an installer. It resolves AgentGuard's
provider-owned `share/agentguard/integrations/opencode/agentguard.js` through
shdeps and copies those bytes to the global OpenCode plugin path
`~/.config/opencode/plugins/dotfiles-agentguard.js`.

All OpenCode event translation, command execution, session bookkeeping,
timeouts, and compatibility tests belong to AgentGuard. This directory does not
carry a local adapter copy. That ownership boundary matters because OpenCode
needs executable glue rather than a declarative hook fragment; letting the
consumer patch that glue would immediately fork its behavior.

## Installation safety

The provider source carries `// agentguard-managed:opencode-plugin` as its first
line. The hook updates only a regular, non-symlink target bearing that marker.
An unmanaged file or symlink at the same path is always preserved with a
warning.

Missing or invalid provider source also preserves the installed target and is
reported as a failed refresh. That visibility matters on a cold bootstrap,
where there is no last-known-good plugin to preserve. A dependency can be
temporarily unavailable during a coordinated repository rollout; treating that
condition as an explicit disable request would remove protection at exactly the
wrong time. Unchanged bytes are not rewritten, so repeat `dot update` runs
preserve inode and modification time.

OpenCode discovers the global plugin directory automatically. No
`opencode.jsonc` entry is generated. A running OpenCode process keeps the plugin
version it loaded at startup, so changes take effect on the next process.

The shared agent-rule merge also writes OpenCode's native global rule target at
`~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. OpenCode can fall back to Claude's global rules,
but relying on that optional compatibility mode would make rule loading depend
on an unrelated runtime remaining installed and enabled.
