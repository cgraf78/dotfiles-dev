# Claude Merge Hook

This directory declares the `claude` merge-hook instance. The executable hook
at `~/.local/lib/dotfiles/merge-hooks.d/claude.sh` builds the source stream in this
order:

1. AgentGuard's native `claude/hooks.json` generation and shared
   `_shared/reconcile-hooks.jq`, resolved through shdeps.
2. Dotfiles and overlay layers from `settings.d/`, in normal family order.

That split is intentional. AgentGuard owns Claude event names, matchers,
commands, environment wiring, and timeouts because those details are reusable
by every AgentGuard user. This directory owns only machine/user policy, such as
the permission allowlist in `settings.d/20-permissions.json`.

The provider generation comes first so local policy and overlays can still
extend or override ordinary Claude settings. AgentGuard's filter replaces old
provider commands and retires old events while preserving user hooks. If either
asset cannot be resolved or validated, the hook reports a failed refresh and
leaves the complete live `~/.claude/settings.json` untouched; it does not apply
permission policy alone against a missing guard base.

Change native hook behavior and its tests in AgentGuard under
`share/agentguard/integrations/claude/`. Keep additions here limited to local
policy that does not belong in a reusable integration.
