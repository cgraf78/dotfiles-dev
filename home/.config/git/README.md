# Git Config

This directory owns machine-wide Git policy for this dotfiles checkout:

- `config` is the global Git config. The dotfiles Git merge hook ensures Git
  loads it even on hosts whose existing `~/.gitconfig` suppresses XDG discovery.
- `attributes` defines repository-neutral working-tree normalization.
- `ignore` is the global ignore file referenced by `core.excludesFile`.

## Boundaries

Keep global Git behavior here when it should apply to every checkout on the
machine. Personal identity belongs in `~/.config/git/config-personal`; work
identity, remotes, or aliases belong in `~/.config/git/config-work`; dev-server
overrides belong in `~/.config/git/config-devserver`. `config` includes those
files when present, ordered from broad personal defaults to narrower overrides.

Git hooks live under
[`~/.local/lib/dotfiles/git-hooks`](../../.local/lib/dotfiles/git-hooks/README.md).
They are executable dotfiles-owned policy, so they belong in the dot runtime
library rather than XDG's architecture-independent data directory. Git invokes
them directly; they are not part of the standalone `dot` runtime.

The PATH-visible `git` launcher is separate from this config; its behavior is
documented in [the command reference](../../../docs/commands.md). It routes
`$HOME` and non-repo descendants to the base client Git directory, whether it
uses the canonical explicit-worktree layout or the supported legacy bare
layout. This directory configures Git after the target repo has been selected.
