# Merge Claude Code settings into ~/.claude/settings.json.
# Runs during standalone Dot client convergence.
# Requires jq.
#
# Layers come from claude/settings.d. Direct files aggregate in lexical order;
# each immediate *.replace directory contributes only its last lexical file, so
# overlays can express personal/work mutual exclusivity without this hook knowing
# those environment names.
#
# Array-valued keys under "permissions" (allow, additionalDirectories) are
# concatenated and deduplicated instead of replaced. Hook arrays are merged
# per event by identity (matcher + command), so a config change to an
# existing hook replaces it instead of appending a duplicate.

# Merge a Claude settings layer into an existing settings.json.
# Policy: source wins on conflicts (same key, different value).
# Existing scalar keys and non-conflicting object keys are preserved.
# Permission arrays (allow, additionalDirectories) are concatenated and
# deduplicated instead of replaced. Hook arrays are merged per event by
# identity (matcher + command) so re-merging is idempotent.
